# Name Entity Relation Project

This project aims to build a Name Entity Relation (NER) system that automates the extraction and classification of named entities from unstructured text data, while also identifying the relationships between them. Utilizing NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project ensures accurate and efficient NER capabilities.

## Features

- **Named Entity Extraction**: The system efficiently identifies and extracts named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations, dates) from raw text documents.
- **Entity Classification**: Allows the system to classify extracted entities into pre-defined classes or custom-defined categories.
- **Relationship Extraction**: Focuses on determining relationships between named entities, enabling the discovery of connections, associations, and dependencies within the text.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employs state-of-the-art machine learning models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, transformer models) to achieve high accuracy in entity recognition and relationship extraction.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Provides functionality to train NER models using labeled datasets and evaluate their performance against annotated test data, enabling continuous improvement and optimization.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Designed to handle large volumes of text data, and easily adaptable to different domains or languages by fine-tuning models and adjusting entity/relationship classes as needed.
